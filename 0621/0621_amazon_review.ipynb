Anything that stays solid at room temperature and is semi gourmet is perfect! Candy bars not so much as they melt while handling. Stuffed full with baby marshmallows and hot chocolate nesquick mix and some brown sugar. My boys loved the rich bombs made in milk. The balls are large and perfect size to fit in a big mug. I stored ours in the fridge.We also painted on two layers of chocolate and cooled in the fridge after each layer. Areas to be careful with are the bomb edges that seal as well as the bottom center, i ended up with a couple holes. No harm done still tasty just not pretty. Yes i recommend it and yes i would buy it again.\",\n",

My first time making hot cocoa bombs was a success because of these molds. There are so many to choose from on Amazon but I think I made the right choice for sure!',\n",
       " 'The mold was the perfect size for a hot chocolate bomb! I read so many reviews before purchasing trying to get something that would be the right size, delivered quickly, & was easy to use. This mold was all of the above. As some mentioned, it is thin, buy that allows for easy removal of the molded item. It does also make it a little flattened on the ends because of that, so we used a cookie sheet underneath to help as it was so flexible and also put some bunched up parchment paper underneath to help take the pressure off of it sitting on the flat surface and it worked great. Kind of a pain to have to do that, but if the mold was harder it would make getting the stuff out of the molds harder. I am very happy with these molds and would purchase them again.',\n",

These spheres are 2.5 inches in diameter and are the perfect size for chocolate bombs! Also very easy to wash - just put them in the dishwasher!  I didn’t have any silicone smell after I put it in the dishwasher as soon as I got it.',\n",
