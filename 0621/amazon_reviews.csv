I recently came across those children and liked them dearly so when choosing a gift for them, I chose this book because the title says so much i.e ""I Love You Through and Through"".

Kathleen M.,5.0,"April 26, 2014",the United States,0,"Kathleen M.5.0 out of 5 starsFantastic Book!!!Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2014Verified Purchase  My son had a slight communication delay, and his speech therapist was concerned about him picking up body language and emotional cues from facial expressions.  I saw this book and thought it would give me the perfect opportunity to really exaggerate the facial expressions to help him learn the emotions.  Little did I know how much he would love this book, it is always the one he chooses when I ask which book he wants to read for bedtime!!  Since there isn't a lot of text, you can really ""act out"" each emotion.  Every time I do an ""emotion"" my son (who is just over 2yrs old) giggles and repeats it.  Then we go to bed and he says, ""I love you troo and troo""...melts my heart!  Now I am on a mission to find a similar book for my daughter who is due in a few months!  :)          HelpfulReport abuseShowing 0 commentsThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I like the board book version the best despite that the book isn't made as well as it once was like all board books. It is smart to tape the binding of all your board books to make them last longer.

Very sweet illustrations, and a sweet little rhyme to accompany them. Would have given 4 stars but it's not a very durable book-- it's a heavy card stock rather than a board book-- so it's more susceptible to rips, tears, and water (ie spittle) damage. Holding up so far-- a couple small tears-- but not sure how long it will last for.          HelpfulReport abuseShowing 0 commentsThere was a problem loading comments right now.

JanP,5.0,"October 21, 2014",the United States,0,"JanP5.0 out of 5 starsOne of the best books we're happy aboutReviewed in the United States on October 21, 2014Verified Purchase  I started reading this book to my son when he was about a month old. He started reacting to certain pages and words around 3-months old and would smile. Now, at almost 10-months old it's one of the books we read to him before the nightly bath time routine and he sits calmly and looks at every page. It will be hard to move on from this book to others as part of our bonding and reading time before the bath but we'll likely revisit it as other books are included in our routine. We read other books (like Goodnight Moon) after the bath but this is one of the faves pre-bath.          HelpfulReport abuseShowing 0 commentsThere was a problem loading comments right now.
